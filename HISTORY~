PBSWeb-Lite History
===================

This is PBSWeb-Lite, a simple web-based interface to PBS/Torque.
PBSWeb-Lite is based on Paul Lu's PBSWeb code, with substantial
re-writting in almost all PHP files. Since the PHP code was modified
by me in a great fraction, I think that it is inappropriate to
keep calling it "PBSWeb". Therefore, I call it "PBSWeb-Lite".

Thanks for works done by Paul Lu et al. Without PBSWeb, there
will be no PBSWeb-Lite.


Version 0.95 -- Thu Mar 18 2004
-------------------------------

This is the first release of PBSWeb-Lite. PBSWeb-Lite is a substantial
re-writing of Paul Lu's PBSWeb codes. Here is a list of differences 
between PBSWeb and PBSWeb-Lite:

  * All PostgreSQL related codes in PBSWeb were removed. PBSWeb-Lite
    does not depend on a SQL server, and all required parameters are
    stored in a config file (config.php).

  * Accounts for PBSWeb-Lite are now directly integrated with the
    Un*x system accounts. PBSWeb-Lite use a simple C program (spasswd.c)
    to validate username and password (assume shadow password!).

  * PBSWeb-Lite support templates for generating PBS scripts. Also, now
    it is possible to create a new job based on a previous saved jobscript.

  * PBSWeb-Lite has a simple web-based file manager that can help user
    to view/download/delete PBS input and output files.
    
  * And many other minor changes that I have forgorten.


Version 0.9 (BUTF Release) of PBSWeb
------------------------------------

PBSWeb-Lite is based on this PBSWeb code written by Paul Lu et al.
Information about PBSWeb can be found here:

http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~pinchak/PBSWeb/

PBSWeb is designed to do the following (from PBSWeb website):

  * Allow the user to submit jobs to PBS without hand-writing 
    a complicated script.
  * Save all scripts submitted by a user for future modification 
    and/or resubmission.
  * Allow a user to submit jobs to any site with equal ease. 
    The site could be across the street or across the country.
  * Allow the user to manage jobs without logging into any remote 
    machines. The user may view jobs in queues and delete any of 
    their currently queued or running jobs.
  * Allow the user to view the output of a job without logging 
    into any remote machine.
  * Do all of this in a secure manner (via SSL), and with utilities 
    commonly available on most Unices.
  * Submit jobs as the actual user, not just on behalf of the 
    user (via SSH).
